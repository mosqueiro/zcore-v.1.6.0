What is ZCore?
----------------

ZCore is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. ZCore uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. ZCore is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.
